<p1>Real State</p1>

 The aim is to develop a system that enables its users and Angolan real estate agencies to have greater dynamism and ease in accessing and updating information related to the real estate market. Thus, the goal is to computerize the services provided by a real estate company that has several agencies spread across the country. The company sells and rents apartments, houses, and land. For houses and apartments, the goal is to store the year of construction, area, location, typology (T1, T2,...), price, and other details. For the land, it is necessary to know whether it is in an urban or rural area, its size, and other characteristics. To use the system, clients must register by providing their personal data. For future system usage, they will only need to enter their login and password. It is also intended that property owners can use the system by automatically entering the details of their properties. For an owner to use the system, they must submit a registration request, which will be approved by the real estate company’s management. After this approval, owners can enter their personal details and information regarding the properties they entrust to the company for sale. The system must allow clients to perform complex searches and reserve properties. However, sales or rentals can only be finalized in person (although clients can reserve properties for a very limited time through the system). The company’s employees have a code, name, the agency where they work, and monthly salary. For each sale, the system records the agency where it was made, the date, the salesperson, the property transacted, and the clients involved (owner and buyer)."
